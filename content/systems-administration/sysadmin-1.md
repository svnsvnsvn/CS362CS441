<div class="question-text">How does systems administration relate to operating systems?</div>

<div class="answer-content">

Systems administration builds upon operating systems knowledge:

- **OS provides the foundation** - understanding how the OS works is crucial
- **Admin tools interact with OS** - most admin tasks use OS-level commands and APIs
- **Resource management** - both involve managing CPU, memory, storage, and I/O
- **User and process management** - core concepts in both domains
- **Security models** - OS security features are leveraged by admin practices
